<h1>Fdf - 1337 Coding School</h1>
<h2><p>This project is about representing a landscape as a 3D object in which all surfaces are outlined in lines.</p></h2>
<p>This project involve Learning how to use the MiniLibX library for graphical functions.</p>
<h3>What do you need to realize this project ??</h3>
<p>To be able to realize this project you will need to learn one of the Drawing Algorithms, which are used in computer graphics for rasterization of various shapes</p>
<h4>Why i choose "Bresenham's line drawing algorithm" ??</h4>
<p>The simple answer is that it has lots of resources to learn it</p>
<h4>Roadmap to learn this algo :</h4>
